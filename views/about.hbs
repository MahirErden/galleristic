 <div class="col-md-6">
   <p>Every artist was first an amateur.Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>

<p>Here at Galleristic, up and coming artists are able to upload their unique artwork, for direct sale to clients, helping them on their journey on cementing their name in the art world. We firmly believe that this unique approach allows artists and clients to create a direct buyer/seller relationship which ultimately benefits the artist and consumer. 

This direct approach allows for lower prices for clients who are just entering the fine art market to avoid the extra fees tacked on by most galleries. This in turn allows the our artists to receive a much fairer price for their work, rather than a large portion going to the gallery.

It doesnâ€™t matter if you are a first time artist looking to break into the market, or an established artist looking for a hub to post their gallery, Galleristic has something for artists of all levels. 

On the flip side, whether you are looking to start your collection, or looking for that missing piece for your gallery. Galleristic aims to have a piece for a collector of any rank. 

Gallerisitic is a full stack project that includes a separate login page for clients and for artists alike. Clients are able to create a login, search for artists and keeps track of these past searches using SQL database .  Artists are able to upload artwork to sell directly to clients. All information stores in SQL database.
